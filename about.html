						Greetings visitor, and welcome to Zheryu.com, a page about me. I will be your guide. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.
						
					</p>
					<p class="content-description">	
						My name is Eric Zhou. If you can read Chinese, my name is also 周宇聪. I experienced childhood down south in San Diego, but recently have moved to the Bay Area to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!).
					</p>
					<p class="content-description">
						I love a solving challenging problems, which is why I am taking many advanced classes like Machine Learning and Efficient Algorithms. Before college, I would usually fill my time with year-long projects, such as the <a>aerial dogfighting game</a> I made in my senior year of highschool. Since then coursework and learning have supplanted my project ambitions. However, I hope to resume making cool things soon, and you can still check out the class projects that I've built on my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.
					</p>
					<p class="content-description">
						Outside of programming I shoot competitively with the UC Berkeley Archery Team, where I am the Ace Barebow shooter. I love experimenting with new techniques and finding more and more effective ways to shoot. 
					</p>
					<p class="content-description">
						Aside from computers and bows, I enjoy surfing Reddit and playing with the neighborhood cat.
					</p>
					<p class="content-description">
						This summer I will be returning to the Ferring Research Institute, where I will help improve the existing database system.
